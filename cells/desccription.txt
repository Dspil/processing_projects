Cells (depicted as circles) eat food (depicted as squares) to grow
Each cell has a velocity, a mature point (in which it can grow) and other characteristics.
If eaten well, the cell will bisect passing his characteristics to the successors with a random mutation.
An evolutionary behaviour in the key cell characteristics can be observed.
There are also viruses (triangles) which infect cells and reproduce after their death and T-cells that eradicate viruses.
One can pause using the key P and after pause can view graphs using the key G
